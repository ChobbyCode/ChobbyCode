Hi, I'm Jacob. A 14 year olds, self taught programmer from the age of 8. I started by learning HTML, CSS & Javascript when I was 8 and created some very basic websites. I later started to learn c# at the age of 9/10. I now stand as an average c# developer with skills in API's, Databases, Frontend Development, and Console Applications. My range of programming languages is not limited to, or by, c#, it expands to a greater length - covering(in total) - HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Java, C#; I also know a handfull of C, and C++.

I prefer to create console applications, as they are easier to create & much easier to work with, but I'm still able to create whatever I want to create. However, I have also created API's, Blazor Web Apps, SQL Databases, and Maui Desktop Applications. You can find a wind range of my tools on my website -> https://chobbycode.github.io
