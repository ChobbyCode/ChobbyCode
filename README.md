### Hey!

Hey, I a 14 year old programmer. I've been programming 6 years (when I was 8): I started with HTML, CSS & Javascript, I later was introduced to CSharp two years later, that would stick as my primary language. I like to program random applications and tools. You can find my website [here](https://chobbycode.github.io/)
